# Triton

This is the development repository of Triton, a language and compiler for writing highly efficient custom Deep-Learning primitives. The aim of Triton is to provide an open-source environment to write fast code at higher productivity than CUDA, but also with higher flexibility than other existing DSLs.

The foundations of this project are described in the following MAPL2019 publication: [Triton: An Intermediate Language and Compiler for Tiled Neural Network Computations](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~htk/publication/2019-mapl-tillet-kung-cox.pdf). Please consider citing this work if you use Triton!

The [official documentation](https://triton-lang.org) contains installation instructions and tutorials.  See also these third-party [Triton puzzles](https://github.com/srush/Triton-Puzzles), which can all be run using the Triton interpreter -- no GPU required.

# Quick Installation

You can install the latest stable release of Triton from pip:

```shell
pip install triton
```

Binary wheels are available for CPython 3.10-3.14.

# Install from source

```shell
git clone https://github.com/triton-lang/triton.git
cd triton

pip install -r python/requirements.txt # build-time dependencies
pip install -e .
```

Or with a virtualenv:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/triton-lang/triton.git
cd triton

python -m venv .venv --prompt triton
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r python/requirements.txt # build-time dependencies
pip install -e .
```

# Building with a custom LLVM

Triton uses LLVM to generate code for GPUs and CPUs.  Normally, the Triton build
downloads a prebuilt LLVM, but you can also build and use LLVM from source.

LLVM does not have a stable API, so the Triton build will not work at an
arbitrary LLVM version.

For convenience, use the following command to build LLVM and install Triton with the custom LLVM:

```shell
make dev-install-llvm
```

<details>
<summary>
Alternatively, follow these steps to build LLVM from source manually.
</summary>

1. Find the version of LLVM that Triton builds against.  Check
`cmake/llvm-hash.txt` to see the current version. For example, if it says:
       49af6502c6dcb4a7f7520178bd14df396f78240c.

   This means that the version of Triton you have builds against
   [LLVM](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) 49af6502.

2. `git checkout` LLVM at this revision.  Optionally, make additional
   modifications to LLVM.

3. [Build LLVM](https://llvm.org/docs/CMake.html).  For example, you might run:

       $ cd $HOME/llvm-project  # your clone of LLVM.
       $ mkdir build
       $ cd build
       $ cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=ON ../llvm -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="mlir;llvm;lld" -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="host;NVPTX;AMDGPU"
       $ ninja

4. Grab a snack, this will take a while.

5. Build Triton as above, but set the following environment variables:

       # Modify as appropriate to point to your LLVM build.
       $ export LLVM_BUILD_DIR=$HOME/llvm-project/build

       $ cd <triton install>
       $ LLVM_INCLUDE_DIRS=$LLVM_BUILD_DIR/include \
         LLVM_LIBRARY_DIR=$LLVM_BUILD_DIR/lib \
         LLVM_SYSPATH=$LLVM_BUILD_DIR \
         pip install -e .

</details>

# Tips for building

- Set `TRITON_BUILD_WITH_CLANG_LLD=true` as an environment variable to use clang
  and lld.  lld in particular results in faster builds.

- Set `TRITON_BUILD_WITH_CCACHE=true` to build with ccache.

- Set `TRITON_HOME=/some/path` to change the location of the `.triton`
  directory where Triton's cache is located and downloads are stored
  during the build. By default, this is the user's home directory. It
  can be changed anytime.

- If you're running out of memory when building Triton, specify the `MAX_JOBS`
  environment variable (to the `pip install -e .` command) to limit the
  number of jobs.

- Pass `--no-build-isolation` to `pip install` to make nop builds faster.
  Without this, every invocation of `pip install` uses a different symlink to
  cmake, and this forces ninja to rebuild most of the `.a` files.

- The build system creates a `compile_commands.json` file under the Triton repo
  directory. This file is used by VSCode IntelliSense and clangd to provide
  code completion and other features for C++ code.

  If IntelliSense does not work, you can try the following steps:

    - Do a local build. Run command `pip install -e .`.
    - Get the full path to the `compile_commands.json` file produced by the build:
      `find ./build -name 'compile_commands.json' | xargs readlink -f`.
      You might get a full path similar to `/Users/{username}/triton/build/cmake.macosx-11.1-arm64-cpython-3.12/compile_commands.json`.
    - In VSCode, install the
      [C/C++
      extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools),
      then open the command palette (`Shift + Command + P` on Mac, or `Shift +
      Ctrl + P` on Windows/Linux) and open `C/C++: Edit Configurations (UI)`.
    - Open "Advanced Settings" and paste the full path to
      `compile_commands.json` into the "Compile Commands" textbox.

# Running tests

There currently isn't a turnkey way to run all the Triton tests, but you can
follow the following recipe:

```shell
# One-time setup.  Note this will reinstall local Triton because torch
# overwrites it with the public version.
$ make dev-install

# To run all tests (requires a GPU)
$ make test

# Or, to run tests without a gpu
$ make test-nogpu
```

# Tips for hacking

For detailed instructions on how to debug Triton's frontend, please refer to this [tutorial](https://triton-lang.org/main/programming-guide/chapter-3/debugging.html). The following includes additional tips for hacking on Triton's backend.

**Configuration knobs**

For a complete reference of all configuration knobs, see the [Configuration Knobs](https://triton-lang.org/main/development/configuration-knobs.html) documentation. You can also refer to [`python/triton/knobs.py`](python/triton/knobs.py) for the full list. You can set those knobs directly in python or use environment variables to control them.

Some commonly used knobs:

- `TRITON_INTERPRET=1` - Run via Python interpreter instead of GPU. You can insert Python breakpoints in your kernel code!
- `TRITON_DEBUG=1` - Enable debug output
- `MLIR_ENABLE_DUMP=1` - Dump IR before every MLIR pass. Use `MLIR_ENABLE_DUMP=kernelName` to dump for a specific kernel only.
- `MLIR_DUMP_PATH` - Specify where `MLIR_ENABLE_DUMP` will dump to. If unset, dumps to stderr.
- `LLVM_IR_ENABLE_DUMP=1` - Dump LLVM IR before every pass
- `TRITON_ALWAYS_COMPILE=1` - Always compile kernels, ignoring cache
- `TRITON_KERNEL_DUMP=1` - Dump IR at each compilation stage
- `TRITON_DUMP_DIR=<dir>` - Directory to save dumped IR and ptx/amdgcn
- `TRITON_KERNEL_OVERRIDE=1` - Enable kernel override mode
- `TRITON_OVERRIDE_DIR=<dir>` - Directory to load IR/ptx/amdgcn files for override

> [!NOTE]
> Some environment variables don't have a knob in `knobs.py` - these are only relevant to the C++ layer(s) and don't exist in the Python layer.

**Kernel Override Steps**

```bash
export TRITON_ALWAYS_COMPILE=1
export TRITON_KERNEL_DUMP=1
export TRITON_DUMP_DIR=<dump_dir>
export TRITON_KERNEL_OVERRIDE=1
export TRITON_OVERRIDE_DIR=<override_dir>
# Step 1: Run the kernel once to dump kernel's IRs and ptx/amdgcn in $TRITON_DUMP_DIR
# Step 2: Copy $TRITON_DUMP_DIR/<kernel_hash> to $TRITON_OVERRIDE_DIR
# Step 3: Delete the stages that you do not want to override and modify the stage you do want to override
# Step 4: Run the kernel again to see the overridden result
```

**Compiler Pipeline Inspection Steps**
To introspect the pipeline `add_stages`, before running your kernels, simply set
the add_stages_inspection_hook like so:

```python
def inspect_stages(_self, stages, options, language, capability):
    # inspect or modify add_stages here
triton.knobs.runtime.add_stages_inspection_hook = inspect_stages
```
Examples of how to use this for out of tree plugin passes is [here](lib/Plugins/README.md)

# Development Container (Dev Container)

**Dev Containers** for the Triton project are available from
the [triton-dev-containers repository](https://github.com/redhat-et/triton-dev-containers).

### Key Benefits:
- **Consistency**: All developers can work with the same development
  environment, ensuring uniform behavior across different systems.
- **Isolation**: The container prevents potential conflicts with software
  installed on your local machine.
- **Portability**: Easily share the development environment with team members,
  minimizing onboarding time and setup issues.

### How to Use the Dev Container:

For detailed instructions on how to use the dev containers, please see
the [dev container user guide](https://github.com/redhat-et/triton-dev-containers/blob/main/.devcontainer/devcontainer.md).
